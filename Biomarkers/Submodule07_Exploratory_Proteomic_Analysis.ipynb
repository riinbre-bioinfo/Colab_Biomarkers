Instead of picking and choosing individual biomarkers, omics data allows us to identify large numbers of correlated variables that may indicate broad biological trends.  There are several benefits of such a strategy.  First, we may identify unknown or unanticipated biomarkers that were not obvious candidates but which are clearly correlated to (but not necessarily causative of) disease states.  Second, we can map this data to biological networks, allowing us to identify metabolic pathways correlated to disease states or to identify regulatory networks that can indicate mechanisms by which the state changes are occurring.  The cost of using omics data however is the so-called \"curse of dimensionality\".  Omics data involves thousands of features (e.g. expressed genes, active proteins, etc.), most of which are not actively changed across states.  Identifying the correlated variables and determining their statistical and biological significance is a challenge when dealing with a single omics layer such as the proteome.  The challenge becomes even greater when attempting to correlate results across different omics layers (known as multiomics) or when comparing similar results across laboratories (meta-analysis).  For this module, we will focus on a traditional bulk proteomics experiment from the rat renal IRI data to identify proteins significantly affected by IRI."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3440e627-8984-4f92-9637-41bd479222c0","metadata":{"id":"3440e627-8984-4f92-9637-41bd479222c0"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","<b>&#9995; Tip:</b> Blue boxes will indicate helpful tips.</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"de503954-faa3-4caf-a187-ade2d6ac46c7","metadata":{"id":"de503954-faa3-4caf-a187-ade2d6ac46c7"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n","<b>&#127891; Note:</b> Used for interesting asides or notes.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d37299fd-ac17-44b8-8af3-64ab55d55559","metadata":{"id":"d37299fd-ac17-44b8-8af3-64ab55d55559"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n","<b>&#9997; Reference:</b> This box indicates a reference for an attached figure or table.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"59fff243-9787-4690-8924-ecf71b2c7fa9","metadata":{"id":"59fff243-9787-4690-8924-ecf71b2c7fa9"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n","<b>&#128721; Caution:</b> A red box indicates potential hazards or pitfalls you may encounter.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b1a533d6-5fa4-48f2-bae3-23220b03d75f","metadata":{"id":"b1a533d6-5fa4-48f2-bae3-23220b03d75f"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"650ae720-e6f0-451f-9fae-5b036bec7608","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"650ae720-e6f0-451f-9fae-5b036bec7608"},"source":["## Identification of Proteomic Biomarkers"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a57eab27-34b3-4d77-af02-55ff48a03fe9","metadata":{"id":"a57eab27-34b3-4d77-af02-55ff48a03fe9"},"source":["### Pre-Analysis Prep"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bbc0cb93-ec6b-4475-9bf7-40103030c175","metadata":{"id":"bbc0cb93-ec6b-4475-9bf7-40103030c175"},"source":["Let's start by loading the required R packages and our experimental object."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b9a966c3-15fc-439d-94e5-d48bbb27a7cd","metadata":{"id":"b9a966c3-15fc-439d-94e5-d48bbb27a7cd"},"outputs":[],"source":["if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(\"devtools\")\n","devtools::install_github(\"kassambara/factoextra\")\n","\n","if (!require(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n","    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n","library('BiocManager')\n","\n","bioc_packages <- c(\"limma\", \"ComplexHeatmap\", \"M3C\")\n","installed_bioc_packages <- bioc_packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())\n","if (any(installed_bioc_packages == FALSE)) {BiocManager::install(bioc_packages[!installed_bioc_packages])}\n","\n","BiocManager::install(\"preprocessCore\")\n","BiocManager::install(\"preprocessCore\", configure.args=\"--disable-threading\", force = TRUE)\n","\n","packages <- c(\"plyr\", \"tidyverse\", \"factoextra\")\n","installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())\n","if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"34521b02-e160-4910-90f8-c6d72f548c8e","metadata":{"id":"34521b02-e160-4910-90f8-c6d72f548c8e"},"outputs":[],"source":["require('preprocessCore')\n","require('limma')\n","require('ComplexHeatmap')\n","require('plyr')\n","require('tidyverse')\n","require('factoextra')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Remember to create a \"data\" folder in Colab and upload your previous rds file from champter 6."],"metadata":{"id":"Mzl4qTflLznO"},"id":"Mzl4qTflLznO"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e3d4a920-8c99-4694-8f40-0bb18be40568","metadata":{"id":"e3d4a920-8c99-4694-8f40-0bb18be40568"},"outputs":[],"source":["# You will need to create a data directory in Colab.
