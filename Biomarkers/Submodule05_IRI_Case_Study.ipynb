The primary functions of the kidney is to regulate various bodily fluids, to maintain electrolyte balance in the blood, and to filter toxins out of the blood.  For this reason, blood tests are commonly used to quickly and easily assay the functions of the kidneys and the liver.  Several serum biomarkers have been identified to indicate liver or kidney damage.  For kidney injury, two common serum biomarkers are serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).  In healthy individuals, concentrations of SCr and BUN are 0.4-0.6 mg/dL and 8-18 mg/dL, respectively.  SCr concentrations >1 mg/dL are generally considered indicative of kidney dysfunction.  While these biomarkers are indicative of kidney injury, they alone do not indicate the type of injury that has occurred.

This damage can be caused by a variety of factors, including chronic hypertension, e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes, and several kidney-specific diseases.  When the kidney has lost 90% of its function, the patient is said to be in end-stage renal disease and requires dialysis support to remove toxins from the blood.  At this point, kidney transplantation from a healthy donor is the only way to restore normal kidney function.  However, kidney transplantation itself puts great stress on the donor kidney.  In addition to the risks of rejection by the host immune system, a kidney from a healthy donor is temporarily removed from the supply of oxygenated blood (ischemia).  When the kidney graft is reattached in the new host, the sudden flow of oxygenated blood (reperfusion) can cause inflammation and oxidative stress to the transplanted organ, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI).  The inflammatory cascade in AKI can include increases in neutrophil and leukocyte activation and increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines.  Severe cases of AKI can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis (programmed cell death), or total organ failure.

While we often think of mitochondria as individual, isolated organelles, they actually form a complex network regulated through biogenesis (new organelles), fission (organelle division) and fusion (organelle combination).  This allows mitochondria to share resources, ensure a stable number of healthy mitochondria, and remove damaged mitochondria.  During ischaemia, ATP stores are depleted, resulting a variety of effects.  Mitochondrial network balance is disrupted as the lack of ATP inhibits mitochondria biogenesis, and the balance in the mitochondrial network shifts to fission resulting in fragmentation of the network which can impair kidney repair.  This in turn leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) which allows release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.  This, coupled with disruption of Na<sup>2</sup> gradients and increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggers damage to the mitochondria and apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the renal cell.
